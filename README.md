Wanna quickly create a spotify playlist of the hostest 100 songs of a particular day in the past. This python program got you covered. Just type in a past date and get such a playlist created for your account in less than a minute. (NOTE: To make this program work, you need to sign up to a spotify developer account so that you can access your client id and client secret. And then replace those variables in the program with yours.)
